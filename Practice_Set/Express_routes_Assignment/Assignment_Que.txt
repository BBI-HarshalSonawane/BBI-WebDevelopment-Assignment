Here we need to try to

1) We create an 2 separate middleware
2) After that we need to create 3rd middleware with "res.send()"
3) After that we need to create an "get" route for "/" default middleware
4) then this "/" middleware need to redirect to "/contact_us" path 
5) In that "/contact_us" path page with "GET" route,  we have an form in which user can give there "name" and "email"
6) on that same "/contact_us" path "POST" route, we need to receive that data and show it on same page
