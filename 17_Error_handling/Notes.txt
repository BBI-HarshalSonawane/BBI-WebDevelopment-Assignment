✅ "Errors thrown" in Node.js applications can be handled in the following ways: 👇👇👇👇

1) Using try-catch block
2) Using callbacks
3) Using promises and promise callbacks
4) Using async-await

✅ Types of errors in JavaScript.

1) Runtime Error 👈:   means operational errors occur when application in "production" 
    Ex.                 Failed to connect to the server
                        Request time out
                        Invalid user input
                        The System is out of memory
                        Failed to resolve hostname
                        The server returned a 500 response


2) Syntax Error 👈: means programmer error, When a syntax error occurs, it does not affect all the code.
    Ex.                 open or close your parentheses or square brackets.

3) Try Catch Syntax 👈: Try-catch declaration to handle "runtime errors" 👈 in node.js,

4) Error Object 👈: Whenever there is a "runtime error" 👈 "Object" of type "Error"❌ and sends it as an argument to catch.
    Error object is composed of two properties. 
    i) name
    ii)message

1️⃣ name: The name type of error, name "Error" , syntax error JSON would throw an exception of type "SyntaxError".
2️⃣ message: The is composed of a text message containing more details of the error.

5) SyntaxError 👈:  when interpreting the code syntaxError is thrown.
